# Hotel Revenue, trends analysis {SQL +Power BI}
Link to Dashboard : http://bit.ly/3O5WLoy
Description: I used a demo excel file which contains data on two types of hotels. I used SQL commands to import the data into Power BI. I used SQL queries like SELECT, LEFT JOIN, and GROUP BY for this project.
I focused on three main questions for arriving at my dashboard:

is the hotel revenue growing by year?
→ we have two types of hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type and analyse
should we increase our parking lot size?
→ the parking percentage is roughly the same in 2018 and 2019 and hence it is difficult to determine if increasing parking space would be a good option or not.
